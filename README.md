## Laundry Manager

#### Ever been tired of searching the laundry basket, whether there is enough of one color to fill a washing machine?

This Arduino setup shows you via an LED whether there is enough of dark, white or coloured laundry available.
The colour is determined when a garment is thrown into the laundry basket.

#### Please note: the color sensor must be individually adapted to the light conditions of each room.
